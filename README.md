# RankReset

> Quickly reset ranks on a server without messing with staff.

## Installation

Grab the latest JAR from the [releases page](https://github.com/DrugLegends/RankReset/releases)!

Also requires that you have [Vault](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/vault) and a permissions plugin of your choice installed.

## Usage

1. [Install](#installation) the JAR
2. Start your server or load RankReset via PlugMan
3. Edit the `plugins/RankReset/config.yml` file to your liking
4. Run `/rankreset reset`

All players currently on the server will be kicked and, upon rejoining, they will have their ranks reset based on your RankReset config file. Additionally, any players who join in the future that have not joined since the rank reset will have their ranks reset.
